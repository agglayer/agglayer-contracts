This JSON file contains the parameters generated by our upgrade script. Below is a breakdown of each field:

- **scheduleData**:  
  The ABI-encoded data that represents the timelock scheduling call. It contains all parameters (target, value, data, predecessor, salt, delay) that the timelock contract will store when the upgrade operation is scheduled.

- **executeData**:  
  The ABI-encoded data for the timelock execution call. This is used later to execute the scheduled operation, triggering the proxy upgrade and any initialization.

- **timelockContractAddress**:  
  The address of the Timelock contract that will manage the delay and execution of the upgrade operation.

- **decodedScheduleData**:  
  A human-readable object that decodes the contents of the scheduled operation:

    - **target**:  
      The contract address that will be called by the timelock (typically the ProxyAdmin contract).
    - **value**:  
      The ETH value to send with the call (usually 0).
    - **data**:  
      The raw encoded data representing the upgrade call (e.g., `upgradeAndCall` with proxy, new implementation, and initialization data).
    - **decodedData**:  
      A further breakdown of the `data` field:
        - **signature**: The function signature being called (e.g., `"upgradeAndCall(address,address,bytes)"`).
        - **selector**: The first 4 bytes of the ABI-encoded function call.
        - **proxy**: The proxy contract address that will be upgraded.
        - **implementation**: The address of the new implementation contract.
        - **data**: The ABI-encoded initialization call for the new implementation.
    - **predecessor**:  
      The hash of a prior operation that must complete before this one; if none exists, this is zero.
    - **salt**:  
      A unique salt used to identify and secure the operation.
    - **delay**:  
      The timelock delay (in seconds) required before the scheduled operation can be executed (e.g., "3600" means a one-hour delay).

This structure allows us to verify and audit every aspect of the upgrade operation before it is executed.
