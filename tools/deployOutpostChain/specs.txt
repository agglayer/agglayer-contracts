In the following folder, we are going to setup an script to deploy an outpost chain, the specs are the following:
- There will be an input json file called deploy_parameters.json as in the other tools of the repo.
    - Group the input params by section
- The output file will be a json file called deploy_output_{current_date}.json with all the necessary output parameters
- The library used to handle all this will be ethers with hardhat
- I would like to have the code very well structured, with a main function that calls different functions for each one of the steps -> analyze structure of other scripts in the tools or upgrade folder of this repository
- The specs of the outpost chains can be found here: https://hackmd.io/_-UpQaxBTdiNc71Mg3ApOQ?view
- All the deployed contracts on th outpost should be done with the CREATE3 pattern to have the same addresses of the contracts in all the different outpost chains where the contracts will be deployed
- At the end of the script, a full set of tests should be done where all the addresses, contracts, storage of the contracts, input params... are checked.
- Use logger lib for logs
- The contracts to be deployed will be:
    - BridgeL2SovereignChain with proxy pattern
    - GlobalExitRootManagerL2SovereignChain with proxy pattern
    - PolygonZkEVMTimelock, will be the owner of the proxy admin
    - Necessary contracts for CREATE3


To discuss:
- Apply onlyOwner at create3 contract?
