# Docker deployment

By default the following mnemonic will be used to deploy the smart contracts `MNEMONIC="test test test test test test test test test test test junk"`.
Also the first 20 accounts of this mnemonic will be funded with ether.
The first account of the mnemonic will be the deployer of the smart contracts and therefore the holder of all the MATIC test tokens, which are necessary to pay the `sendBatch` transactions.
You can change the deployment `mnemonic` creating a `.env` file in the project root with the following variable:
`MNEMONIC=<YOUR_MENMONIC>`

## Requirements

- node version: 14.x

- `programVKey`: program key for pessimistic consensus
- `isVanillaClient`: Flag for vanilla/sovereign clients handling
- `aggchainParams`: Only mandatory if consensusContract is AggchainECDSA or AggchainFEP
    - `initParams`: Only mandatory if consensusContract is AggchainFEP
        - `l2BlockTime`: The time between L2 blocks in seconds
        - `rollupConfigHash`: The hash of the chain's rollup configuration
        - `startingOutputRoot`: Init output root
        - `startingBlockNumber`: The number of the first L2 block
        - `startingTimestamp`: The timestamp of the first L2 block
        - `submissionInterval`: The minimum interval in L2 blocks at which checkpoints must be submitted

        - `optimisticModeManager`: Address that can trigger the optimistic mode
        - `aggregationVkey`: The verification key of the aggregation SP1 program.
        - `rangeVkeyCommitment`: The 32 byte commitment to the BabyBear representation of the verification key of the range SP1 program.
    - `useDefaultVkeys`: bool, flag to use default verification keys from AgglayerGateway
    - `useDefaultSigners`: bool, flag to use default signers from AgglayerGateway
    - `ownedAggchainVKey`: bytes32, Initial owned aggchain verification key
    - `aggchainVKeySelector`: bytes2, Initial aggchain selector

## Run script

In project root execute:

```
npm i
npm run docker:contracts
```

or

```
npm i
npm run dockerv2:contracts
```

A new docker `geth-zkevm-contracts:latest` will be created
This docker will contain a geth node with the deployed contracts
The deployment output can be found in:

- `docker/deploymentOutput/create_rollup_output.json`
- `docker/deploymentOutput/deploy_output.json`
- `docker/deploymentOutput/genesis.json`
- `docker/deploymentOutput/genesis_sovereign.json`

To run the docker you can use: `docker run -p 8545:8545 geth-zkevm-contracts:latest`

or

```
npm i
npm run dockerv2:contracts:all
```

It's the same docker as before but deploying `AggchainECDSA` & `PolygonPessimisticConsensus`.

To create other rollup:

- copy template from `./docker/scripts/v2/create_rollup_parameters_docker-xxxx.json` to `deployment/v2/create_rollup_parameters.json`
- copy `genesis.json`, `genesis_sovereign.json` and `deploy_ouput.json` (from `docker/deploymentOutput`) to `deployment/v2/`
- run `npx hardhat run ./deployment/v2/4_createRollup.ts --network localhost`
- If you want, you can copy the file that has been generated here (`deployment/v2/create_rollup_output_*.json`) to deployment output folder (`docker/deploymentOutput`)
