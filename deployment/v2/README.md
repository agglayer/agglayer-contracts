## Requirements

- node version: 14.x
- npm version: 7.x

## Deployment

In project root execute:

```
npm i
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill `.env` with your `MNEMONIC` and `INFURA_PROJECT_ID`
If you want to verify the contracts also fill the `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`

```
cd deployment
cp deploy_parameters.json.example deploy_parameters.json
```

Fill created `deploy_parameters.json` with appropriate parameters.
See below for more information about the `deploy_parameters.json`

The first step is deploying and verifying the `PolygonZkEVMDeployer`, this will be the factory for deterministic contracts, the address of the contracts will depend on the `salt` and the `initialZkEVMDeployerOwner`

This contract is deployed using a keyless deployment, therefore the gasPrice is hardcoded.
The value is on `100 gweis`, if it's necessary to update it go to `helpers/deployment-helpers.js` and update the `gasPriceKeylessDeployment` constant.
Note that this operation will change all the deterministic address deployed.

```
npm run deploy:deployer:ZkEVM:goerli
npm run verify:deployer:ZkEVM:goerli
```

To deploy on testnet is necessary a token MATIC contract, therefore, there's another script that previously to the actual deployment, deploys a matic contracts and adds it automatically to the `deploy_parameters.json`

To deploy on testnet use:`deploy:testnet:ZkEVM:${network}`

In other cases use fulfill `maticTokenAddress` in the `deploy_parameters.json` and run `deploy:ZkEVM:${network}`

```
npm run deploy:testnet:ZkEVM:goerli

```

To verify contracts use `npm run verify:ZkEVM:${network}`

```
npm run verify:ZkEVM:goerli
```

A new folder will be created with the following name `deployments/${network}_$(date +%s)` with all the output information and the OZ proxy information.

### Optional Parameters on both parameters

- `deployerPvtKey`: string, pvtKey of the deployer, overrides the address in `MNEMONIC` of `.env` if exist
- `maxFeePerGas`: string, Set `maxFeePerGas`, must define as well `maxPriorityFeePerGas` to use it
- `maxPriorityFeePerGas`: string, Set `maxPriorityFeePerGas`, must define as well `maxFeePerGas` to use it
- `multiplierGas`: number, Gas multiplier with 3 decimals. If `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas` are set, this will not take effect
- `dataAvailabilityProtocol`: string, Data availability protocol, only mandatory/used when consensus contract is a Validium, currently the only supported value is: `PolygonDataCommittee`

## Notes

- Since there are deterministic address you cannot deploy twice on the same network using the same `salt` and `initialZkEVMDeployerOwner`. Changing one of them is enough to make a new deployment.
- It's mandatory to delete the `.openzeppelin` upgradeability information in order to make a new deployment
- `genesis.json` has been generated using the tool: `1_createGenesis`, this script depends on the `deploy_parameters` as well.
